Hi Im Ethan 

I used to be a lawyer in South Africa, but I moved to the UK in 2022 and became a bartender in a busy pub in London. 

Im currently trying to teach myself to become a data analyst.

Im busy plodding my way through the Google Data Analytics course while also working on a few of my own side projects.
